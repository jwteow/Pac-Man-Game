# Pac-Man-Game ðŸŽ®

A project for a course at Uni where I had to build a Pac-Man game from scratch in Java.
The game can be run via the "ShadowPac.java" file in any Java supported IDE. In the game there are two levels: 

- Level 0
  - the aim is to collect all the dots. In the 
second level, the aim is to reach a score of 800 by eating dots, fruit or ghosts. 
In both levels there are ghosts that can damage Pac Man, in the first level they are 
stationary and in the second each ghost has a different movement pattern and speed based 
on their colour. 

Here is a demo of the game:
