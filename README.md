# Pac-Man-Game ðŸŽ®

A project for a course at Uni where I had to build a Pac-Man game from scratch in Java.
The game can be run via the "ShadowPac.java" file in any Java supported IDE. In the game there are two levels: 

- Level 0:
  - Win condition: collect all dots and avoid ghosts
  - Lose condition: running out of lives from hitting ghosts
  - Ghosts are stationary
- Here is a demo of winning and losing in level 0:
- Level 1:
  - Win condition: reach a score of 800
    - How to earn points: collect dots, cherries or eating the ghosts by collecting the pellet
  - Lose condition: running out of lives from hitting ghosts
  - Ghost movement pattern differ based on their colour
- Here is a demo of winning and losing in level 1:
